Subject: [Lucane-translations] Lucane 0.7.4-beta2 has been released
Message-ID: <b8c61c210412011325dba43cc@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

As we made a lot of changes since 0.7.4-beta, we can't publish a
stable release yet.

Most of the changes are for WebConnector. A lot of applications now
have a web interface : User Profile, Notes, Password Changer,
RssReader, Calendar, and Todolist. Forum and forum admin were already
available in 0.7.4-beta.

A few bugs were fixed, especially the one preventing SSL to work.

Have fun,
Vincent.

Hello,

I'm proud to announce Lucane 0.7.4 !
Don't be fooled by the version number, this is actually a major release.

The main new thing is WebConnector, a component allowing you to access 
to Lucane's application through the web.
Other applications have evolved : calendar, todolist, forum, ...
A new Slideshow application has been added.

Please read the changes (including screenshots) here :

Thanks to everyone invovled,
Vincent.

Hello,

I added ssl to webconnector, so i needed to add a few options in
webadmin, and rename the existing ones to avoid any confusion.

Here are the new/changed messages :

lbl.http.enabled = Enable HTTP
lbl.http.port = HTTP Port
lbl.https.enabled = Enable HTTPS (SSL)
lbl.https.port = HTTPS Port
lbl.https.keystorePasswd = Keystore Password
lbl.https.keyPasswd = Key Password

Thanks !
Vincent.
